## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a combination of Development and Operation skills which help to bridge the gap between the two, and creates the tools that make the development and deployment pipeline more efficient through the automation.

The main reason why DevOps became so popular lays in its benefits, which are:

* Improved efficiency - by automating processes teams are able to release product quicker
* Adaptability - as DevOps mainly uses Agile methodology, it allows the team to be more flexible and adapt to the customers needs
* Improved Collaboration - as we established in its term, DevOps helps to reduce the gap between Development and Operation teams and make their communication better
* Security - DevOps helps to integrate security protocols into agile workflow

### 4 Main Pillars of DevOps

* Communication - face to face communications are important. Team has to constantly communicate with each other to improve the quality of their product, troubleshoot any problems and learn from each other.
* Collaboration - better collaboration between development and Operation teams helps to better prepare the product that goes from development into deployment.
* Automation - it is the core of the DevOps. It helps to reduce the time gap between development and deployment stages, making the delivery of the product more efficient.
* Monitoring - provides an information about service uptime and performance. This information can help the team to determine any areas of improvements that could be done for the next release.
